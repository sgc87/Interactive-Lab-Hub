## Project Idea

The idea is to have a smart kitchen, starting off with a smart toaster. Using a microcontroller, a toaster will be turned into 
a smart device. Using a low powered, small microcontroller, using PWM output, the toaster will have its spring mechanism 
pushed down by a servo motor. It will be either alarm based or by command through Alexa over WiFi.
