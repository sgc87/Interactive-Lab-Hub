## Project Idea

The idea is to have a smart kitchen, starting off with a smart toaster. Using a microcontroller, a toaster will be turned into 
a smart device. Using a low powered, small microcontroller, using PWM output, the toaster will have its spring mechanism 
pushed down by a servo motor. It will be either alarm based or by command through Alexa over WiFi. 

## Expected Parts

[Adafruit Trinket Microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501)

Servo Motor

3D Printed actuating parts

Motor Mounts

## Interaction Plan

People will set a desired time through a phone app or through Alexa to have the toaster automatically toast bread for you.
